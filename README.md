Context and background: 
YOUR ROLE You   work   in   a   project   management   consultancy   partnership that   undertakes   contracts from   clients   and works   with them to   plan   and   manage   internal   service   development   projects that   include   IT   design   and   development.   The   projects   that   you   plan   and   manage   are   implemented   by   a   combination   of   the   client’s   staff   and   external   contractors that you source through the   IT Contractor   Rates Guide   by   HAYS   (See the file uploaded to Moodle).
THE CLIENT 
PixelForge Games is a dynamic game development company with a passion for creating immersive experiences.   They   specialise   in   creating   console   games   and   downloadable   content   (DLCs).   PixelForge’s   client   base   includes   both console gamers and enthusiasts who appreciate high-quality titles   for exceptional player experiences.   They   operate in competitive markets, and   recognise that creativity is the   lifeblood of the gaming   industry. To achieve   this   strategic   objective,   they   actively   push   boundaries   by   developing   games   that   are   innovative   and   have   rich   storytelling   and   captivating   visual   design.   PixelForge   also   aims   to   establish   a   strong    position   in   the   console   gaming   market,   emphasising   on   recognition   and   enjoyment   by   wide   audiences   as   critical   success   factors.   To   achieve   this,   they   strategically   position   their   titles   to   appeal   to   console   gamers   who   represent   a   substantial   market segment.   PixelForge aims to stand out to   a   loyal   client   base   and gain visibility,   recognition,   and   increase   in   revenue.Their current annual revenue currently stands at   $10   million, and   management   is   expecting   a   10%   increase   over   the   next   18   months.   Recognising the   importance of   player   retention, they set other   KPIs to   increase their active   users   over the   same   period. They   expect their   user   retention to   increase:   (i)   Week   1   Retention   (W1)   –   players   who continue   playing after the first week to   increase from the current 20% to   50%;   (ii)   Month   1   Retention   (M1)-   players   who   remain   engaged   after   a   month   from   the   current   10%   to   35%.;   and   (iii)   Three-Month   Retention
(M3) –   players whose   interests are sustained over three   months   to   change   the   current   5%   to   a   solid   15%.
THE CONTRACT 
PixelForge’s   senior   management   have   announced   creation   of   a   portfolio   package   of   up   to   4   DLCs   add-ons   to   extend sales and bring in new   customers. They allocated   a   budget   of   $900K   on   a   portfolio   of   up to four   projects   to enter   new   markets and achieve their strategic   goals   of   increasing   revenue   and   increasing   player   retention.Assignment   1   relates   to   Phase   1   of   their   contract   with   your   firm   which   involves   developing   comprehensive   business   cases   (project   proposals)   that   align   with   the   portfolio   objectives   and   business   strategies.   Your   client   would   review the project   proposals and shortlist the 4   most   relevant   proposals. The successful   proposals would   join forces   and form. teams to   work   towards   achieving   portfolio   objectives   in   Assignments   2   and   3   (Phases   2    3 of the   contract).The   technology   aspects   of   the   project   are   to   be   implemented   by   their   in-house   team   of   experts.   However,   all   the   remaining   costs   for   the   projects   (and   any   profit   that   your   partnership   intends   to   make)   must   come   out   of the $900K   budget.Note that   the   $900K   budget   is   for   the   entire   portfolio   of   up   to   4   projects and not just the one project you are proposing and therefore,   it   is   important to   budget carefully where all   expected   costs   and   expenses   are justified   and   there   are   considerations   for   other   potential   projects   in   the   portfolio.   The   portfolio   of   projects   must   be   completed   within   18   months   of   the   contract   start   date.   Your   client   did   not   specify   the   expected   schedule   for   each individual   project   proposal;   however, they expect the schedule,   budget and   scope   of   work   (requirements,   deliverables,   delivery   approach and cadence) to   be   balanced and feasible.
ASSIGNMENT TASK 
Your task   is to   develop   a comprehensive   business case   (project   proposal) to   present   to   your   client   for   decision   making. Your   business case should address the following   criteria:
Business Justification 
-             Start with   some   background   information   of   the   business   and   portfolio   to   set   the   scene.
-             Demonstrate the alignment of the   project with business strategies   and   portfolio   objectives: Why   is your   proposed   project a good fit for the   business and the   portfolio?
-             Current   Situation   and   Problem/Opportunity   Statement:   Discuss   how   and why   the   current   situation,   as   mentioned       in      the       case,       presents an opportunity/problem for   the portfolio. Demonstrate the   contribution of the   project to the value   deliv代 写FIT2002 Project Management Semester 2, 2024 Assignment OneJava

-             Provide   an   overview   of   three   options (tentative    solutions) to address the Problem/Opportunity   identified and compare the options followed   by   a   clear   conclusion   and   recommendation   for the   client.   This    would    assist    the    decision    makers    in    their    assessment of your project    and      let    them      make    an   ‘informed’   decision.   When   identifying   and   analysing   the   three   options,   consider   the   role   of   human-   computer   interactions   and   whether   your   proposed   options   are   more   human-focused   or   technology-   focused.
o   The   comparison   should   include   a   high   level   and   brief   comparison   of the   financial   implications   of      the      options.      Use      of      suitable      comparison      tools      such      as      weighted      scoring      models      is   encouraged.
-             Describe   project   deliverables   including   characteristics   of the   product   and   project   outcomes.
-             A   reflection on   any   ethical   implications   of the   project   or   products. You   will   find   resources   in   Moodle   to   enhance your   understanding of ethics   in   project   management.

Schedule Estimate Estimate   time   required   for   the   project   and   a   project   go-live   date.   Include   at   least   three   high   level   milestones   with   justifications   in   this   section.    Demonstrate   that   the   schedule,   budget   and   scope   of   the   work   (including   deliverables and   requirements,   project   delivery   approach and cadence) are   balanced   and   feasible.
Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis 
-             A    preliminary   estimate    of   the   costs   and   benefits   of   the    project   through   an   NPV/ROI   calculation   The   calculation should be supported by sufficient   justification and   references for the   on-going   maintenance   and   project   benefit   estimates.
-             All supporting   and   additional   information should   be   included   in   the   Exhibits   section –   such   as   the   initial   project   investment,   on-going   maintenance   cost   and   projected   benefit/profit.   The   text   in   the   Exhibit   section   is   not   included   in the word   limit   of the   assignment.
Development Approach: Explain and justify the development approach The   development   approach   should   be   aligned   with   stakeholder   and   client   values,   types   and   the   number   of deliverables      and      the      feasibility      within      the      constraints      of      the      project      (expected      schedule,      budget      and   outcome/deliverable   requirements).
Uncertainty and Risk analysis 
Summarise   the   top   two   potential   risks   that   this   project   might   face   and   your   proposed   response   strategy   to   navigate through the   uncertainty.
Quality Metrics and Measurement Provide a description of the quality attributes for your main   product   and   how to   measure   them.   Include   at   least   two   attributes.   Where   possible,   include   two   Key   performance   indicators   (KPIs)   that   are   specific   to   the   project   and can   be   used to evaluate the success   of   a   project   in   delivering the   product.
